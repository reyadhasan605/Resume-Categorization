preprocess_text
The preprocess_text function is designed to clean and preprocess text data by performing several key operations: tokenization, punctuation and numeric value removal, stop word removal, and lemmatization. The resulting cleaned text is returned as a single string, ready for use in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or information retrieval.

Parameters
text (str):
The input string containing the text to be preprocessed.
Returns
cleaned_text (str):
A string containing the preprocessed text, where the words are lowercased, punctuation and numeric values are removed, stop words are filtered out, and the remaining words are lemmatized.
Function Details
Tokenization:

The text is converted to lowercase using text.lower() to ensure uniformity.
The word_tokenize function splits the text into individual words or tokens, which makes it easier to perform further processing steps.
Removing Punctuation and Numeric Values:

The function filters out punctuation characters using string.punctuation and excludes numeric values using not token.isnumeric().
Removing Stop Words:

Common stop words (e.g., "is," "and," "the") are removed using a predefined set of stop words (stop_words). This helps in reducing noise in the text data.
Lemmatization:

The WordNetLemmatizer is used to reduce words to their base or root form, making the text more standardized and meaningful. For example, "running" becomes "run" and "better" becomes "good."
Joining Tokens Back into a String:

After all preprocessing steps are complete, the tokens are rejoined into a single string using ' '.join(lemmatized_tokens), which forms the final cleaned text.

*Conclusion:*

Text preprocessing is essential to ensure that the text data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. The `preprocess_text` function combines tokenization, punctuation removal, stop word removal, and lemmatization to create cleaned and standardized text that can be fed into a machine learning model for further analysis, such as resume categorization.
